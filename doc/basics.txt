\section installing Installing PLUMED

PLUMED is meant as a plugin which can be combined with several molecular
dynamics (MD) engines which should be downloaded separately.
As of PLUMED version 1.2.2, supported
MD engines are
- GROMACS
- NAMD
- AMBER
- DLPOLY
- ACEMD
- LAMMPS
- QuantumESPRESSO


To be able to use PLUMED you have to:
- Download, configure and compile the MD engine (note: some of them require a
  license).
- Download PLUMED <a href="http://www.plumed-code.org">here</a>.
- Patch the MD engine using the proper patching script in PLUMED distribution
  (in the \c patches/ directory)
- Recompile the MD engine

For more information, see the PLUMED manual at http://www.plumed-code.org

This tutorial is based exclusively on LAMMPS and QuantumESPRESSO, which are
open source projects that can be obtained free of charge.

PLUMED also contains a few extra tools, including one to plot the free energy
surface from a metadynamics simulation (\c utilities/sum_hills) and a driver to use PLUMED
without an MD code to analyze a given trajectory (\c utilities/driver). Proper
instructions to compile these tools can be found in the manual.

In the following we will assume that the user has in the execution path the
following commands:
- \c lmp_plumed which is the patched LAMMPS executable.
- \c pw_plumed.x which is the patched Quantum ESPRESSO executable.
- \c sum_hills which is the program to plot free energies from metadynamics
  simulations.
- \c driver which is the tool to analyze trajectories.

In case you don't have these commands in your path, you should follow
installation instructions in the PLUMED manual to install these programs.

\section activating Activating PLUMED

The patched executable, by default, performs a standard molecular dynamics.
If you want to use PLUMED, you should first tell to the MD code to activate
it. The procedure depends on the code you are using.
Options which are specific to PLUMED (e.g.: which collective variable to use,
the parameters for metadynamics simulations, etc.)
will be specified on an extra input file, usually named \c plumed.dat .

For LAMMPS, you should add a fix \c plumed in the input script, as in following
example:
\verbatim
fix plumed all plumed plumedfile plumed.dat outfile plumed.out
\endverbatim
The \c plumedfile options sets the name of the PLUMED input file.
The \c outfile options sets the name of the PLUMED output file.

Note that you can use only a single plumed fix.
