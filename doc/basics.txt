\section installing Installing PLUMED

PLUMED is meant as a plugin which can be combined with several molecular
dynamics (MD) engines which should be downloaded separately.
As of PLUMED version 1.2.2, supported MD engines are
- GROMACS (3.3.3 - 4.0.7 - 4.5.3)
- NAMD (2.6 - 2.7)
- DLPOLY (2.16 - 2.19 - 2.20)
- AMBER (9.0 - 10.0; sander module only)
- ACEMD (1.1)
- LAMMPS (15 Jan 2010 - 24 Sep 2010)
- QUANTUM-ESPRESSO (4.1.2 - 4.2.0)

In general, the correct procedure to install PLUMED is:
- Download, configure and compile the MD engine (note: some of them require a
  license).
- Download PLUMED <a href="http://www.plumed-code.org">here</a>.
- Patch the MD engine using the proper patching script in PLUMED distribution
  (in the \c patches/ directory)
- Recompile the MD engine

<b>This tutorial is based exclusively on PLUMED, LAMMPS and QuantumESPRESSO (QE), which are
open source projects that can be obtained free of charge.</b>

For more information, see the PLUMED manual at http://www.plumed-code.org

Notice that the QE community is releasing independently an <em>ad hoc</em>
version of PLUMED which may have some difference with respect to the official
PLUMED+QE patch. Here we are going to use the official PLUMED+QE version,
which is based on QE-4.2.

PLUMED also contains a few extra tools, including one to plot the free energy
surface from a metadynamics simulation (\c utilities/sum_hills) and a driver to use PLUMED
without an MD code to analyze a given trajectory (\c utilities/driver). Proper
instructions to compile these tools can be found in the manual.

In the following we will assume that the user has in the execution path the
following commands:
- \c lmp_plumed which is the patched LAMMPS executable.
- \c pw_plumed.x which is the patched executable for the pw.x module of QE.
- \c sum_hills and \c sum_hills_mpi, which are programs to plot free energies from metadynamics
  simulations.
- \c driver which is the tool to analyze trajectories.

In case you don't have these commands in your path, you should follow
installation instructions in the PLUMED manual to install them.

\section activating Activating PLUMED

The patched executable, by default, performs a standard molecular dynamics.
If you want to use PLUMED, you should first tell to the MD code to activate
it. The procedure depends on the code you are using.
Options which are specific to PLUMED (e.g.: which collective variable to use,
the parameters for metadynamics simulations, etc.)
will be specified on an extra input file, usually named \c plumed.dat .

For LAMMPS, you should add a fix \c plumed in the input script, as in following
example:
\verbatim
fix plumed all plumed plumedfile plumed.dat outfile plumed.out
\endverbatim
The \c plumedfile options sets the name of the PLUMED input file.
The \c outfile options sets the name of the PLUMED output file.
Note that you can use only a single plumed fix.

For QE, you should add a \c use_plumed keyword to the \c control namelist, as
in this example
\verbatim
  &control
     title = 'ch3cl',
     calculation='md'
     restart_mode='from_scratch',
     dt=20,
     nstep=2000,
     prefix = 'md',
     use_plumed=true
  /
\endverbatim
Notice that for QE the name of the plumed input
file is hardcoded to \c plumed.dat and the output file is hardcoded to
\c PLUMED.out. Also notice that this way of switching on PLUMED is going to
change in the next release (and it has already been changed in the PLUMED
version that you find in the QE website). In case of doubt, refer
to the proper documentation.
