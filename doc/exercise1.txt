\page exercise1 Exercise I: Stone-Wales transformation in a carbon nanotube

As an example of an activated process in a condensed matter system we consider
the Stone-Wales transformation in a carbon nanotube. This transformation
can be seen as the rotation of a C-C dimer by 90\f$^\circ\f$, which leads
to the conversion of four hexagons into two pentagons and two heptagons.
During the process, which has been observed e.g. in nanotubes subject
to strain, overall two covalent bonds are broken and two are formed, resulting
in a large energy barrier of several eV.
Here we consider a 480-atoms (10,0) carbon nanotube periodically repeated,
and we adopt the AIREBO interatomic potential as implemented in lammps.
One can imagine different suitable reaction coordinates for the Stone-Wales
transformation. Here we use the number of covalent three-atoms bridges 
among different groups of atoms, as detailed in Fig. ZZ
Rotation of the C-C dimer leads to breaking of two "vertical" bridges
and to forming two "horizontal" bridges. A suitable PLUMED CV is
\c WATERBRIDGE (the name water has only historical sense since the CV
was originally implemented to count the H-bonded bridges formed by water
molecules between two protein surfaces).

Input file for the Stone-Wales transformation in a carbon nanotube
with LAMMPS:

PRINT W_STRIDE 10

Within 10 ps of simulation, the Stone-Wales transformation occurs reversibly
multiple times, and a FES can be reconstructed with \c sum_hills:
\verbatim
$ sum_hills -file HILLS -out fes.dat -ndim 2 -ndw 1 2
\endverbatim
\verbatim
$ gnuplot
> set pm3d
> set contour base
> splot 'fes.dat' with pm3d
\endverbatim
