/**
\page exercise2 Exercise II: SN2 reaction

This section will show a simple chemical reaction example done with QUANTUM
ESPRESSO  code.
This code is meant here to do Born-Oppenheimer dynamics but PLUMED is also  
implemented to work in the Car-Parrinello module of the suite.
The goal of the exercise is to calculate the free energy for the reaction
depicted in SN2.
This reaction has been studied before XXX and here we will
try to sketch out the barriers but the aim is to take a short amount of time.

\verbatim
&control
    title = 'ch3cl',
    calculation='md'
    restart_mode='from_scratch',
    pseudo_dir = '.',
    outdir='.',
    dt=20,
    nstep=2000,
    disk_io='low',
    prefix = 'md',
    use_plumed = .true.,
 /
\endverbatim
Pay attention: in this code distances are in Bohr (1 Bohr = 0.529177249 A)
and the energies in Rydberg ( 1 Ry=  313.755 kcal/mol ).


For Metadynamics a possible input can be 
\verbatim
# switching on metadynamics and Gaussian parameters
HILLS HEIGHT 0.001 W_STRIDE 2
# instruction for CVs printout
PRINT W_STRIDE 1
# the distance between C-Cl' and C-Cl
DISTANCE LIST 1 3 SIGMA 0.3
DISTANCE LIST 2 3 SIGMA 0.3
#WALLS: prevent to depart the two mols
UWALL CV 1 LIMIT 7.0 KAPPA 100.0
LWALL CV 1 LIMIT 2.5 KAPPA 100.0
UWALL CV 2 LIMIT 7.0 KAPPA 100.0
LWALL CV 2 LIMIT 2.5 KAPPA 100.0
# end of the input
ENDPLUMED
\endverbatim
Look at this same exercize in the full tutorial to see how to study this
problem using different techniques!
