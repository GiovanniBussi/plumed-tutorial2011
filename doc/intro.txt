This is a short tutorial for 
<a href="http://www.plumed-code.org">PLUMED</a>, meant to quickly introduce
users to metadynamics using classical and ab initio molecular dynamics, with
<a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantum-espresso.org/">QuantumESPRESSO</a> respectively,
and it is targeted for the students of the
<a href="http://pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/ascms/">Advanced School on Computational
Materials Science for Energy and Environmental Applications</a>
held in Santo Andr√©, Brazil from 5 to 16 September 2011.
It is basically a collection of adapted excerpts from
a longer tutorial which can be found 
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/plumedtutorial2010">here</a>.
The parts stolen from the longer tutorial were prepared by
Massimiliano Bonomi, Davide Branduardi and Fabio Pietrucci,
who are strongly acknowledged here.

The versions of the softwares used to prepare this tutorial are:
PLUMED v1.2.2, LAMMPS v23Aug11, QuantumESPRESSO v4.2, albeit it should
work also with newer versions. These softwares will be assumed to be
available and already compiled.

To download PLUMED and to find further documentation, mailing lists, etc.,
the right place is the PLUMED webpage at http://www.plumed-code.org
