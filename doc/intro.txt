This is a short tutorial for 
<a href="http://www.plumed-code.org">PLUMED</a>, meant to quickly introduce
users to metadynamics using classical and ab initio molecular dynamics, with
<a href="http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS</a> and
<a href="http://www.quantum-espresso.org/">QuantumESPRESSO</a> respectively,
and it is targeted for the students of the
<a href="http://pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/ascms/">Advanced School on Computational
Materials Science for Energy and Environmental Applications</a>
held in Santo Andr√©, Brazil from 5 to 16 September 2011.
It is basically a collection of adapted excerpts from
a longer tutorial which can be found 
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/plumedtutorial2010">here</a>.
The parts stolen from the longer tutorial were prepared by
Massimiliano Bonomi, Davide Branduardi and Fabio Pietrucci,
who are strongly acknowledged here.

This tutorial is based on PLUMED-1.2.2
